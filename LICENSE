Use it for free, pay if you get paid. If you make a commercial product with this extension included (e.g. getting paid from a client who wants to have a website made of this product), then I would kindly ask you to give a small financial support for about 25 USD to keep this project floating around the world wide web.

You have the right to determine the price of your project without any interference from me. You may be able to discuss this additional cost with your client, honestly, without the need to keep anything confidential. I want everything to be transparent so that no one feels aggrieved.

I started this project as a way to get people to leave social media which tends to shape the habit of spamming. I miss the existence of bloggers in the past who like to display photos, poems and short stories, with various effects of animated cursors and snow falling on their blogs that really makes me dizzy. They might all have gone extinct. It was a beautiful past.

Note: If you are from Indonesia and are having problems with the current rupiah exchange rate against the dollar, you are allowed to consider 25 USD as 250,000 IDR.

Thank you üíïÔ∏è
