You need to install [Alert][1] and [User][2] extension to activate this control panel feature.

This is the official control panel extension. It has been designed with a very simple look, but underneath it has a lot
of potential for expansion. The initial design consisted of a single column interface which would generally only present
you with either a file list view or a file editor view.

This control panel is intentionally designed to be displayed on devices with medium screen sizes like tablets. I assume
people are most likely to get inspired to write when they are out on vacation. It’s easier to carry around a compact
device like a tablet (usually with a detachable keyboard). Using a tablet also does not require the author to power
on/off the device which takes time. People usually lose their ideas when they don’t jot them down right away.

### Skin

Skin feature can be enabled by installing the [Panel Skin][3] extension. You can then apply the control panel skin that
you want. They are usually available as separate extensions. Some commercial layouts may also provide their own control
panel skin. The following are some control panel skins that you can apply:

 - [Construction](https://github.com/mecha-cms/x.panel.skin.construction)
 - [Default](https://github.com/mecha-cms/x.panel.skin.default)

Once installed, the skin option should be available on the control panel settings page that you can activate.
