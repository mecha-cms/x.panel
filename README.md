You must install the [Alert][1] and [User][2] extension to enable this control panel feature.

This is the official control panel extension. It was designed with a very simple look, but underneath it has a lot of
potential for expansion. The initial design consisted of a single column interface that would generally only present you
with either a file list view or a file editor view.

This control panel is intentionally designed to be displayed on devices with medium screen sizes, such as tablets. I
assume that people are most likely to be inspired to write when they are on vacation. It’s easier to carry around a
compact device like a tablet (usually with a detachable keyboard). Using a tablet also eliminates the need for the
author to turn the device on and off, which takes time. People usually lose their ideas if they don’t write them down
right away.

### Skin

Skin feature can be enabled by installing the [Panel Skin][3] extension. You can then apply the control panel skin you
want. They are usually available as separate extensions. Some commercial layouts may also provide their own control
panel skin. Below are some control panel skins that you can apply:

 - [Construction](https://github.com/mecha-cms/x.panel.skin.construction)
 - [Default](https://github.com/mecha-cms/x.panel.skin.default)

Once installed, the skin option should be available on the control panel settings page for you to enable.
